# Changelog

All notable changes to goindex are documented here. The format is loosely based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project tracks work
via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vindicare3162/NZB-Indexer/issues).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial goindex implementation: NNTP scanning pipeline (scan → assemble →
  release → post-process → NZB), Newznab-compatible API, JSON REST API, Svelte
  web UI, auth (users/API keys/roles/rate limiting), and Docker packaging.
- Project tracking scaffolding: issue templates, PR template, and this changelog.

### Fixed
- NNTP header scanning now uses `XOVER` (with an `OVER` fallback) instead of the
  RFC 3977 `OVER` command, which providers such as Eweka reject. Replaced the
  `chrisfarms/nntp` dependency with a direct `net/textproto` implementation.
